When an employee incurs business expenses, the reimbursement process begins with 
the employee completing an expense report. The report must include receipts for 
travel, meals, or supplies, along with a clear description of the business purpose. 
Once the report is submitted, the department manager reviews it for accuracy and 
policy compliance. If the expenses exceed the manager’s approval threshold, the 
report is escalated to the finance director for further review.

After approval, the finance team enters the reimbursement request into the 
accounting system. They verify bank details and schedule payment in the next 
payroll cycle. If discrepancies are found, the finance team contacts the employee 
to resolve them before processing. Finally, the employee receives reimbursement 
via direct deposit and a confirmation email.

This process ensures that all expenses are properly documented, reviewed, and 
reimbursed in a timely manner.
