When a new employee joins the company, the onboarding process begins with the 
HR specialist reaching out to collect all required documentation. This includes 
the signed offer letter, government identification, and completed tax forms. 
Once these items are verified, the HR specialist creates an official employee 
record in the HRIS system, ensuring that the profile is complete and accurate.

After the profile is established, the IT administrator steps in to provision 
accounts. They generate email credentials, Slack access, and any system logins 
the employee will need. If the role requires elevated permissions, the 
administrator consults with IT Security before granting access.

With accounts ready, the hiring manager schedules an orientation session. 
During this meeting, the manager reviews company policies, explains available 
benefits, and sets expectations for the role. The employee receives orientation 
materials and has the opportunity to ask questions.

Following orientation, the manager assigns a mentor to guide the employee 
through their first ninety days. The mentor is responsible for scheduling 
an initial check‑in and providing ongoing support. This step ensures the 
new hire has a clear point of contact as they integrate into the team.
