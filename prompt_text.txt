Extract the process flow and return it strictly as valid JSON.

The JSON must have this structure:

{
  "process_name": "Name of the process",
  "process_description": "Brief description",
  "source_document": "Document 1.txt",
  "document_path": "Path to document",
  "extraction_model": "mistral",
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_number": 1,
      "step_name": "Short name",
      "description": "Detailed description",
      "responsible_role": "Role",
      "inputs": ["Input A", "Input B"],
      "outputs": ["Output A"],
      "tools": ["Tool A"],
      "decision_points": ["Condition A"],
      "next_steps": [2, 3]
    }
  ]
}

Return ONLY valid JSON. Ensure the JSON is complete, with all arrays and objects properly closed.
