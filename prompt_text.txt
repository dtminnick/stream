You are an expert at analyzing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and 
extracting structured process flow information.

Analyze the following SOP document and extract the process flow structure. 

Return a JSON object with the following structure:

{{
    "process_name": "Name of the process",
    "process_description": "Brief description of the overall process",
    "source_document": "Document 1.txt",
    "document_path": "Path to document",
    "extraction_model": "gpt-4.1",
    "steps": [
        {{
            "step_number": 1,
            "step_name": "Short name of the step",
            "description": "Detailed description of what happens in this step",
            "responsible_role": "Role or person responsible for this step",
            "inputs": ["List of inputs required"],
            "outputs": ["List of outputs produced"],
            "tools": ["ARK", "ACE"], 
            "decision_points": ["Any decision points or conditions"],
            "next_steps": [2, 3]  // Step numbers that follow this step
        }}
    ]
}}

Focus on:
- Sequential flow of steps
- Decision points and branching logic
- Roles and responsibilities
- Inputs and outputs for each step
- Tools, systems, or resources used

Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text or explanation.
