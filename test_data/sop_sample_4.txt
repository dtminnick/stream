The enterprise data migration process begins with the project sponsor authorizing 
a migration initiative. The sponsor provides a charter document that outlines 
objectives, budget, and timelines. Once approved, the project manager assembles 
a cross‑functional migration team including database administrators, system 
architects, business analysts, and QA testers.

The first step is requirements gathering. Business analysts interview stakeholders 
to identify critical datasets, compliance requirements, and downtime tolerances. 
They compile a requirements specification document. The project manager reviews this 
document and confirms scope with the sponsor.

Next comes data assessment. Database administrators run profiling scripts against 
legacy systems to identify data quality issues, duplicate records, and schema 
inconsistencies. They generate assessment reports and share them with the architects. 
If severe issues are found, the team decides whether to cleanse data before migration.

In the architecture design phase, system architects create a migration blueprint. 
This includes mapping legacy schemas to target schemas, defining ETL pipelines, 
and selecting tools such as Talend or Informatica. They also design rollback 
strategies. The blueprint is reviewed in a design meeting. If approved, the team 
proceeds.

The environment setup follows. Infrastructure engineers provision staging servers, 
configure network access, and install migration tools. They validate connectivity 
between source and target systems. If connectivity fails, they escalate to network 
security.

Once environments are ready, the team performs a pilot migration. A subset of data 
is extracted, transformed, and loaded into the target system. QA testers validate 
record counts, field mappings, and business rules. If discrepancies exceed tolerance 
thresholds, the architects adjust transformation logic.

After a successful pilot, the team executes the full migration. Data is migrated 
in batches to minimize downtime. The project manager monitors progress dashboards. 
If errors occur, the migration script logs are analyzed and rerun.

Following migration, QA testers conduct post‑migration validation. They run 
reconciliation reports comparing source and target datasets. Business users 
perform functional tests to ensure applications behave correctly with the new data. 
If critical defects are found, rollback procedures are triggered.

Once validation passes, the cutover phase begins. The project manager schedules 
a go‑live window. Legacy systems are decommissioned, and users are redirected to 
the new environment. IT support staff remain on standby to resolve issues.

Finally, the team conducts a post‑implementation review. Lessons learned are 
documented, compliance reports are filed, and the sponsor signs off on project 
closure. Knowledge transfer sessions are held so operations staff can maintain 
the new system.
