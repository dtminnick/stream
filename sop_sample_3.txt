The product development lifecycle begins with the product manager drafting 
a proposal based on market research and customer feedback. This proposal 
outlines objectives, target audience, and expected outcomes. Once drafted, 
the proposal is reviewed by the executive committee. If approved, the 
project moves into the design phase.

During design, UX designers create wireframes and prototypes, while engineers 
provide technical feasibility assessments. The design team uses tools like 
Figma and Jira to collaborate. Once prototypes are finalized, a design review 
meeting is held. If the committee approves, development begins.

In development, engineers build the product using agile sprints. Each 
sprint includes planning, coding, testing, and review. QA testers validate 
functionality against requirements, logging issues in the bug tracking system. 
If critical bugs are found, the sprint is extended until resolved.

After several sprints, the product enters user acceptance testing (UAT). 
Selected customers test the product in real scenarios. Feedback is collected 
and prioritized. If UAT passes, the release manager prepares deployment scripts 
and coordinates with IT operations.

Deployment involves rolling out the product to production servers, monitoring 
system performance, and ensuring rollback plans are in place. Once live, 
the customer support team is trained to handle inquiries. The product manager 
schedules a post‑launch review to evaluate success metrics and gather lessons learned.

This lifecycle ensures that products are designed, built, tested, and 
deployed with quality and customer focus.
